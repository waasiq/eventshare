# Frontend Code of Eraslify

This is the frontend code of Eraslify. It is written in React and uses the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) library. I am using Typescript for type safety.

## How to run
To run the frontend, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, run the following commands in the frontend directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
